As a teenager, he got himself hired at Hewlett-Packard, a Silicon Valley computer giant. He dropped out of college and landed a job at Atari, a maker of video games. Called to pursue a spiritual quest, he left the corporate scene and traveled to India.  Upon his return to the US, he went back to Atari but not for long. In 1976, Jobs and his pal Steve Wozniak made a circuit board in their garage that they called The Apple.  At Steve\u2019s urging, Woz designed a computer that was small enough and useful enough for businesses and consumers alike. Woz, the engineering genius, and Jobs, the charismatic visionary, successfully parlayed their perfect combination of skills and talents into a business. By the time he was 24, Job's Apple Corporation was worth $10 million. A year later, its value had grown to $100 million. Its graphical user interface, business applications and word processing won kudos, and millions cheered while Apple took on IBM and its personal computer.  \n\nAs the Apple empire grew, Steve became a tyrant, subject to moody outbursts and gloomy silences.  Hard feelings arose and power struggles with other executives ensued.  Jobs resigned on September 17, 1985. The following year, 1986, he co-founded NeXt in an attempt to do for the hardware industry what he had down for software.  With ever-broadening vision, he also bought a company which he renamed Pixar Animation Studios. He negotiated a deal with Disney to distribute Pixar\u2019s films and became a Disney partner. Under Jobs\u2019 leadership, Pixar won 20 Academy awards for such successful animated feature films as \u201cToy Story,\u201d \u201cA Bug\u2019s Life\u201d and \u201cFinding Nemo.\u201d In January 2006 Disney entered into an acquisition agreement with Pixar, leaving Jobs with a very large share of Disney stock and a seat on the Board of Directors.\n\nWith a twist of fate and a show of will, he convinced Apple to buy NeXt and was invited back to Apple in 1997 as interim CEO.  In 2000, he was made permanent CEO. Under Jobs\u2019 leadership Apple computer became a player in the computer industry once more.  Jobs\u2019 team created visually aesthetic computers in bright colors that appealed to younger buyers.  The company\u2019s venture into the entertainment industry fueled the growing coffers.  In 2001 the company introduced the iPod and ITunes, enabling millions to listen to their favorite music on command.  In September 2006 he unveiled his plans to use a similar model to enable consumers to download movies on their computers.\n\nJobs\u2019 successes have provided endless fascination for students of business and product innovation.  On June 20, 1999, a made-for-TV movie related the story of Jobs, Woz and Bill Gates, \"The Pirates of Silicon Valley.\"  On a personal note, Jobs has four children: a daughter from his \u201870s romance with his girlfriend and three children with his wife Laurene whom he married in 1991.  The Apple Computer Company founder underwent surgery to remove a cancerous pancreatic tumor on July 31, 2004.  The tumor reportedly was self-contained and no further treatment was deemed necessary. In early January 2009, looking quite thin, announced that doctors have found the reason for his loss of weight: a hormonal imbalance causing an inability to digest protein. On January 14, 2009 he announced he was taking a leave of absence to take care of his health problems, which, he said, were more complex than previously thought. Toward the end of June, it was announced that he had undergone a liver transplant in Tennessee two months earlier. Although he returned to work, he looked quite thin. On January 17, 2011 he announced an indefinite  leave of absence so that he can \"focus on my health.\" He added that he would continue to be CEO and be involved in strategic decisions of the company. He returned to his post but on August 24, 2011 he announced that he was resigning from the CEO's position, effective immediately..\n\nOn October 5, 2011 at 3:00 PM*, Jobs died of metastasized pancreatic cancer and respiratory arrest at his home in Palo Alto, CA.\n\n*According to Forbes online citing birth certificate.\n\n[[wikipedia:Steve_Jobs|Link to Wikipedia biography]]\n\n[http://www.astrodienst.com/cgi/forum.cgi?num=1000036161 Link to Astrodienst discussion forum]\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:Birthday 24 February]]\n[[Category:Birthplace San Francisco, CA (US)]]\n[[Category:Sun 5 Pisces]]\n[[Category:Moon 7 Aries]]\n[[Category:Asc 22 Virgo]]\n==Relationships==\n{{ASTRODATABANK_rel\n|RelatedDatamainID=11657\n|PName=Wozniak, Steve\n|PName_link=Wozniak, Steve\n|Pbdate=11 August 1950\n|CodeID=840\n|sreltext=business associate/partner relationship with\n|srelcat=Associates\n|srelitem=Business Associate/Partner\n|RelQualityCode=0\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_rel\n|RelatedDatamainID=12913\n|PName=Gates, Bill\n|PName_link=Gates, Bill\n|Pbdate=28 October 1955\n|CodeID=839\n|sreltext=opponent/rival/enemy relationship with\n|srelcat=Associates\n|srelitem=Opponent/Rival/Enemy\n|RelQualityCode=0\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_rel\n|RelatedDatamainID=55239\n|PName=Apple, Shares\n|PName_link=Apple, Shares\n|Pbdate=12 December 1980\n|CodeID=879\n|sreltext=compare to chart of\n|srelcat=Misc.\n|srelitem=Compare to chart of...\n|RelQualityCode=0\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_rel\n|RelatedDatamainID=55241\n|PName=Business: Apple iPad\n|PName_link=Business: Apple iPad\n|Pbdate=27 January 2010\n|CodeID=879\n|sreltext=compare to chart of\n|srelcat=Misc.\n|srelitem=Compare to chart of...\n|RelQualityCode=0\n}}\n==Events==\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=778\n|sevcode=Work : Begin Major Project\n|EventNotes=First circuit board made\n|sevdate=1976/00/00\n|sevdate_dmy=1976\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=14\n|EventString=1976\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=2\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=2879\n|sevcode=Financial : Best Period\n|EventNotes=Went from $10 million to $100 million\n|sevdate=1979/00/00\n|sevdate_dmy=1979\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=14\n|EventString=1979\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=5\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=2869\n|sevcode=Work : Retired\n|EventNotes=Resigned from Apple\n|sevdate=1985/09/17\n|sevdate_dmy=17 September 1985\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=8\n|EventString=9/17/1985\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=2\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=822\n|sevcode=Work : New Job\n|EventNotes=Interim CEO of Apple Computers\n|sevdate=1996/00/00\n|sevdate_dmy=1996\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=14\n|EventString=1996\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=2\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=929\n|sevcode=Social : Great Publicity\n|EventNotes=TV movie about him, Woz and Gates\n|sevdate=1999/06/20\n|sevdate_dmy=20 June 1999\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=8\n|EventString=6/20/1999\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=2\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=820\n|sevcode=Work : Gain social status\n|EventNotes=Permanent CEO position\n|sevdate=2000/00/00\n|sevdate_dmy=2000\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=14\n|EventString=2000\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=2\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=746\n|sevcode=Health : Medical diagnosis\n|EventNotes=pancreatic tumor\n|sevdate=2004/00/00\n|sevdate_dmy=2004\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=14\n|EventString=2004\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=2\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=747\n|sevcode=Health : Medical procedure\n|EventNotes=surgery to remove cancerous pancreatic tumor\n|sevdate=2004/07/31\n|sevdate_dmy=31 July 2004\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=8\n|EventString=7/31/2004\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=2\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=744\n|sevcode=Health : Change in Appearance\n|EventNotes=Lost a lot of weight\n|sevdate=2008/00/00\n|sevdate_dmy=2008\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=14\n|EventString=2008\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=2\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=747\n|sevcode=Health : Medical procedure\n|EventNotes=Liver transplant\n|sevdate=2009/00/00\n|sevdate_dmy=2009\n|ctimetype=s\n|ccalendar=g\n|ctzauto=u\n|TimeAccuracyCode=14\n|EventString=2009\n|DurationQuantity=1\n|DurationUnitCode=2\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_evn\n|CodeID=833\n|sevcode=Social : Secrets revealed\n|EventNotes=Liver transplant two months prior;

Parents' names are given as Clara Hagopian born in NJ and Paul Reinhold Jobs, born in Wisconsin. These are his adoptive parents' names. \n\nPreviously time on this record was 6:00 AM and the source notes read as follows: LMR quotes Jeffrey S. Young, \"Steve Jobs: The Journey is The Reward,\" Lynx Pocket Books, NY 1988, p.16, \"On February 24, 1955 in San Francisco.... the Moon, Sun and rising star were all in Pisces.\"  This would be a time between 6:40 and 7:55 AM PST and is blatant artistic license as it is an impossible combination.  At 0 Pisces rising (6:39 AM PST) the Moon is already at 0 Aries: to have the Sun and Moon in Pisces he would have to be born earlier and the ASC would be in Aquarius, or even Capricorn.\n\nSon of Joanne Simpson - send for B.C.\n\n5/07/2002, San Francisco Bureau called, they have no record under this name and date.  In October 2005 PT adds a note from \"Sean\" who posted a message on the AstroDatabank website that Jobs was born in Green Bay, WI.  Wikipedia does give Green Bay and if Jobs were born at about 6:32 there, he would have 00 Pisces rising and the Moon would be at 29 Pisces.  As Jobs is adopted it is unlikely that we would be able to obtain a birth certificate. The entry at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs gives the following information: \"Born to an American mother, Joanne Simpson, and a Syrian father, Abdulfattah (\"John\") Jandali, a political science professor, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, After being put up for adoption, he was adopted soon after birth as a \"John Doe\" Baby by Paul and Clara Jobs of Mountain View, Santa Clara County, California. Paul and Clara Jobs gave him the name Steven Paul Jobs. His biological parents later married and gave birth to Jobs' biological sister the novelist Mona Simpson, who is married to Richard Appel. The marriage of his biological parents ended in divorce years later. To this day, Jobs dislikes Paul and Clara Jobs being called his adoptive parents, and prefers to simply refer to them as his \"parents.\"\n==Categories==\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=24\n|scat=Diagnoses : Major Diseases : Cancer\n|CategoryNotes=\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=624\n|scat=Diagnoses : Body Part Problems : Liver/Pancreas/Spleen\n|CategoryNotes=\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=47\n|scat=Diagnoses : Body Part Problems : Surgery\n|CategoryNotes=\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=70\n|scat=Diagnoses : Psychological : Abuse Drugs\n|CategoryNotes=Acid in the '70s\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=143\n|scat=Family : Childhood : Adopted\n|CategoryNotes=\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=155\n|scat=Family : Childhood : Order of birth\n|CategoryNotes=First of two adopted kids\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=188\n|scat=Family : Relationship : Number of Marriages\n|CategoryNotes=One\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=198\n|scat=Family : Parenting : Kids more than 3\n|CategoryNotes=Four; one with girlfriend\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=2931\n|scat=Personal : Birth : Illegitimate birth\n|CategoryNotes=\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=290\n|scat=Personal : Death : Illness/ Disease\n|CategoryNotes=\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=360\n|scat=Vocation : Business : Entrepreneur\n|CategoryNotes=Apple computers\n}}\n{{ASTRODATABANK_cat\n|CodeID=302\n|scat=Notable : Famous : Founder/ originator\n|CategoryNotes=Founder of Apple computers\n}}", "contentmodel": "wikitext", "contentformat": "text/x-wiki"}], "title": "Jobs, Steve"}}}}
